react-redux-authentication-boilerplate
=======================================

This is a biolerplate application I have developed that using react and redux as well as JWT and Passport for authentication baked in, so you can simply clone the application and get authentication features that you can build on top of with react and redux. More documentation on setting everything up coming soon
